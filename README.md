# chu
A jellyrific IRC bot that uses GitHub webhooks to post pretty messages to an
IRC channel of your choice.

Set it as a webhook on your repo (or org!) and send all events. Don't forget
to copy config.example.json to config.json and modify it to your liking.

It's not the cleanest of code, but it gets the job done.

The main instance of Chu is IA on EsperNet, run by unascribed. PM him on IRC if
you want to set up the bot in your channel.
